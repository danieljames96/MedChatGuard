Here's a clear step-by-step guide to help you start building **MedChatGuard** from scratch:

---

## ✅ **Step-by-Step Development Plan**

### 🧱 1. **Project Setup**
- Clone the repo or create the directory structure as described in the README.
- Set up a Python virtual environment and install dependencies:
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### 🔐 2. **Configure Environment Variables**
- Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
  ```bash
  HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_hf_key
  OPENAI_API_KEY=optional
  LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=optional
  ```

---

## 📚 3. **Data Preparation**
- Download synthetic EHR data from [Synthea](https://synthetichealth.github.io/synthea/).
- Place it under the `data/` directory.
- Optionally include public guidelines from CDC or WHO.

---

## 🤖 4. **Create Embeddings & Vector Store**
- Write `embedding.py` to:
  - Load the EHR chunks
  - Generate embeddings using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
  - Store them in a FAISS index in `embeddings/`

- Write `faiss_builder.py` to:
  - Load and update the FAISS index periodically

---

## 🧠 5. **Build the RAG Pipeline**
- In `pipeline.py`, create a LangChain pipeline that:
  - Accepts user query
  - Retrieves relevant EHR segments
  - Constructs a prompt
  - Calls the LLM via Hugging Face API

---

## 🔄 6. **Add Agentic Logic with LangGraph**
- In `agents/`, define:
  - Retrieval Node
  - Clinical Summarizer Node
  - Guardrails Validator Node
- Build the LangGraph agent flow to orchestrate these steps.

---

## 🛡️ 7. **Guardrails & Safety**
- In `guardrails.py`, add:
  - Format enforcement using Guardrails.ai
  - Speculative claim filters

---

## 📊 8. **Integrate Evaluation Tools**
- In `evaluation.py`, connect to:
  - **TruLens** or **LangSmith** for trace and score logging
  - Track hallucination risk, prompt latency, etc.

---

## 🧪 9. **Enable Experiment Tracking with MLflow**
- Integrate MLflow in `pipeline.py`:
  - Log model name, embedding settings, prompt version
  - Track performance metrics of generated responses

---

## 🔁 10. **Automate with Apache Airflow**
- Create the Airflow DAG in `airflow/dags/ehr_pipeline_dag.py` to:
  - Run `embedding.py` daily
  - Rebuild FAISS with `faiss_builder.py`
  - Optionally trigger evaluation

---

## 🖥️ 11. **Build UI Interface**
- In `app.py`, create a user-friendly chatbot with:
  - `Streamlit` or `Gradio`
  - Query input
  - Display of retrieved context + LLM response
  - Feedback buttons (thumbs up/down)

---

## 🔧 12. **Fine-Tuning (Optional Advanced)**
- In `finetune/`:
  - Add a QLoRA-based script to fine-tune a small open-source LLM on your synthetic EHR responses
  - Log results to MLflow for comparison

---

## 📈 13. **Run & Evaluate**
- Run your app locally and simulate patient queries.
- Use the MLflow UI (`mlflow ui`) to monitor experiments.
- Use LangSmith or TruLens dashboards to track quality metrics.
